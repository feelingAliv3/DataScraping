    "There was a kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news) by Two Sigma a few months ago, looking to identify any potential correlation between news event and stock performance. In the competition, news and stock market data were provided. The source of data are from Thomson Reuters and Intrino (which is part of Thomson Reuters as well). One of the key feature in the news data is sentiment score (and confidence of the score). Unfortunately, there was no clarification/details on the sentiment scoring model. A sentiment score (can sometimes be refer as polarity score) refers to having negative, postive or neutral expression.\n",

    "## Strategy\n",
    "The \"Hello World\" of Sentiment Analysis begins with \"Classifying IMDB movie reviews\". The following is a good starting point using vectorization techniques (bag-of-words) with machine learning model (https://towardsdatascience.com/sentiment-analysis-with-python-part-1-5ce197074184). The general strategy for bag-of-words is to : <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "1. Remove any non-essential characters (commas, semicolons, angled brackets, etc) - removing punctuation, HTML tags, forced lower case<br>\n",
    "    a. removing stop words - words that do not carry weights (i.e. they, we, if, I, you, etc)<br>\n",
    "    b. stemming and lemmatization<br>\n",
    "        i. stemming - cut off words to root words (brute force) <br>\n",
    "        ii. lemmatization - complex transformation to root words <br>\n",
    "2. Vectorize/Tokenize every word in all comments (document database is also known as corpus) <br>\n",
    "    a. vectorize combination of word (n-gram technique) <br>\n",
    "    b. vectorize words importance and words count with inverse relationship (TF-IDF) (i.e. words that appear many times have lower importance than words that appear once or twice) <br>\n",
    "3. Match X (vector) and Y (score) and use sklearn library to train a model <br>\n",
    "    a. the produced vector are typically sparse in nature - lots of zeros (i.e. some words are not found in other comments). Common model is to use SVM with linear kernel for separation. <br>\n",
    "    b. optional : use a neural network to classify sentiment."
